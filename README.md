# aldo

Collecting faces for fun and profit!

Aldo is the development base for a new yet-to-be named project by valo.media UG 
(haftungsbeschr√§nkt), whose purpose is to aid media agencies with the management 
of their pages and advertising campaigns on Facebook.

## Project status

Aldo is pre-alpha software.  You will encounter build failures and breaking 
changes.  Do not use this software in a production environment.

## Setup instructions

Set up a Linux build server.  These instructions are for Ubuntu, but they should 
work in a similar fashion for all unix systems.  This guide assumes you have at 
least ubuntu-standard and build-essential installed.

1. [Install 
   node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions).
2. Make sure you installed node correctly:
    * Running ```node -v``` should display ```v4.0.0``` or greater.
    * Running ```npm -v``` should display version ```3.0.0``` or greater.
3. Create a directory to run Aldo from and change into it by running 
   ```mkdir -p /srv/www && cd /srv/www```.
4. Download aldo and change to its directory by running ```git clone 
   https://github.com/valomedia/aldo && cd aldo```.
5. Install npm packages and run Aldo by running ```npm install && npm 
   start```.
6. To quit Aldo hit ```^c```.

When Aldo is running a browser should automatically open and display the user 
interface.  If you are running Aldo on a headless server, point your browser to 
:3000 to see the interface.  Please remember, that this software is not ready 
for production.

There are serveral ways to run Aldo, depending on what you want to do with it.

* ```npm run build``` will compile Aldo.
* ```npm run build:w``` will compile Aldo and automatically recompile when 
  the code has changed.
* ```npm run serve``` will run the server, allowing you to use a version of 
  Aldo you previously compiled.
* ```npm start``` will compile Aldo and run the server, automatically 
  recompiling and restarting when you make changes.  It is recommended to 
  use this setting for development work.

Aldo also defines a few run modes for running tests, however no test suites are 
so far implemented.
