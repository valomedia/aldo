    /*
     * This is madness.
     *
     * So a few classes need stuff injected into them, but they also have 
     * constructor parameters.  One way to solve this would be 
     * https://github.com/angular/di.js/issues/22#issuecomment-39874167, but 
     * this means, that every Service that returns GraphApiObjects would need to 
     * get a factory for these injected.  Then those GraphApiObjects would in 
     * turn get injected Services for all their edges, creating a circular 
     * dependency, since Facebook's graph DB is not a directed graph.
     *
     * Another technique I have tried for way too long to get working is to have 
     * a GraphApiObjectService, that will build a GraphApiObject and add its 
     * dependencies to it.  That way only the GraphApiObjectService has to 
     * depend on the Services that create GraphApiObjects and FbService can 
     * simply inject GraphApiObjectService, passing it the constructor and 
     * parameters, instead of creating the GraphApiObject directly.  The issue 
     * here is that FbService will depend on GraphApiObjectService, which will 
     * in turn depend on all the services, that return GraphApiObjects, which of 
     * course themselves depend on the FbService we started with in the first 
     * place.  In therory this should be fixable with forwardRef(), or by 
     * fidgeting around with setTimeout(), but I could not get it to work for 
     * the hell of it.
     *
     * My last hope was having the GraphApiObjectService not be injectable at 
     * all, instead just calling its constructor directly in the FbService, 
     * providing the service itself via this and having GraphApiObjectService in 
     * turn create its dependencies by simply calling their constructors with 
     * the FbService I passed.  But for some weird reason this still throws 
     * dependency cycle errors.  https://stackoverflow.com/a/43887382/8380968 
     * talks about having to use separate files and dynamic typing to trick the 
     * framework into not recognizing the dependencies... what the hell kind of 
     * framework is this even?  Never again -.-
     *
     * This solution is somewhat messy as well, but at least it keeps all the 
     * mess in one place, where it is easy to keep track of.  The problem is 
     * that this relies on the dependencies for Angular's Services staying the 
     * same.  Since these are not part of the public API as far as I can tell, 
     * this makes this in its essence very similar to playing russian roulette, 
     * except you never stop pulling the trigger, you just go until you get 
     * hurt.
     *
     * To work around this chance of random breakage, I will freeze Angular's 
     * version, before this app goes into production.  However this is not 
     * a permanent solution.  A permanent solution could be to have FbService 
     * use XMLHttpRequest instead of @angular/http, but I feel hesitant to go to 
     * a place, where I essentially cannot make use of the framework in the most 
     * essential parts of the Application, although Angular regularly gives me 
     * the feeling, that this app could be so much simpler if it was built with 
     * no framework whatsoever.
